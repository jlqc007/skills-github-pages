📢 Welcome to My Dev Hub!
July 11, 2025

Hey there, fellow coders 👋

Welcome to my corner of the internet — a place where I share dev tips, project updates, and the occasional bug-induced existential crisis.

I'm currently deep in the trenches building a timekeeping/project management app using Angular on the front end and a robust backend with a little database wizardry. If you're into full-stack adventures, GitHub migrations, or making front-end code behave without flipping tables — you're in the right spot.

Stay tuned for walkthroughs, lessons learned, and maybe even a few “aha!” moments I probably should’ve figured out sooner.

Until next push —
Happy coding, and may your merges always be conflict-free.
